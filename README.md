# msdn

This is a plain text database of the filenames and SHA-1 hashes of all MSDN downloads (at least all the ones that are publicly accessible without any login). It's sorted and separated per the first letter of the download, but if you want to search globally you can use the GitHub search for this repository. Try searching `14c1a741fd69038cc426ac51eaffd25f1511ec47`!

## Why?

Many times I found myself wanting to validate a MSDN download against its original hash, and most of the time searching it on Google is fine, but for some lesser known files it's harder. You can of course go to the MSDN website and search the hash of the file you're looking for, but the interface is a bit of a pain. So I made a scraper and now the information is easily searchable and grepable now.

## Why CSV?

GitHub [renders CSV nicely](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-csv-and-tsv-data/) with a search field on the top, so it seemed like a good choice.
